# dissertation
Hi!

Here, you find replication files for my dissertation. I also added the dissertation itself as a PDF, but the official publication is at the University of Konstanz (http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bsz:352-2-gipcjfvawwrq1).

The replication files are organized by chapter, each chapter entils a folder for the data and a folder for the code. In the code-folder you can find the executable R-code. In case you wish to look up a specific table or just skim through the code without having to run it fully, you there are also markdown-files with code and output as a PDF.
